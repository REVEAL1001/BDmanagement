                We are non-profit organization based in Baneshwor, Kathamandu. In Nepal, we need hundreds of blood donations every day. Blood products are used in the treatment of surgical patients, accident victims, cancer patients, and premature babies, just to mention something.
                Blood donation is open for almost everyone with only a few limitations based on the medical conditions of the blood donor. 

                Blood donation in Nepal is of paramount importance, as it plays a crucial role in saving lives and enhancing the overall health of the population. The country faces numerous challenges, including a high incidence of road accidents, natural disasters, and a prevalence of chronic illnesses that require blood transfusions. In such a context, a reliable and sufficient blood supply is essential for treating trauma victims, supporting surgical procedures, and managing chronic conditions like thalassemia and cancer. Moreover, voluntary blood donation fosters a sense of community solidarity, encouraging individuals to contribute to the well-being of others and creating a culture of altruism. It also helps to build a sustainable national blood supply, reducing reliance on paid donors and ensuring the safety and quality of blood products. Additionally, blood donation campaigns raise awareness about the importance of this life-saving act, dispelling myths and encouraging more people to participate. By supporting healthcare infrastructure and meeting the needs of vulnerable populations, blood donation not only saves lives but also promotes a culture of health and responsibility within society. Ultimately, the act of donating blood is a powerful testament to the compassion and resilience of the Nepali people, making it an indispensable part of the nationâ€™s healthcare system.
